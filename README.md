## Introduction

As frequent bakers, we noticed that keeping track of tasks that are happening at the same time, especially those that are time-related, can be hard to coordinate in a centralized location. Home bakers, for example, might have to juggle several time-related tasks (e.g., different steps in multiple recipes), each with its own nuances. Even for experienced bakers, it can be hard to remember which tasks take certain amounts of time or which timer is tied to a certain task. Thus, it often falls on web or mobile apps to help the user keep track of the time and/or which step of the recipe they are on.

This web application is made for people who often multitask in the kitchen when baking. Users will include people who bake in a casual setting such as at home and in a professional setting such as a bakery kitchen. These users can view and interact with a personal recipe catalog or menu and a dashboard that displays all the current items in progress and their respective timers. Users will be able to create an account and input recipes for their catalog/menu in a similar fashion to existing recipe apps, but the main functionality of the application will be the dashboard of timers. Geared with a collection of recipes to choose from, the user can select an item from their catalog/menu, choose what stage of recipe they are on (e.g., kneading, proofing, or baking), select the location/appliance the process is taking place in (e.g., stand mixer, proofing drawer, or oven) and start the timer.
